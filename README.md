- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexisBoucherie. I am 33 yo and I'm French.

- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the world, meeting new people, reading, hiking and playing RPGs. And of course coding, but is it really worth telling? ;)

- 🌱 I had the chance to be a tour guide for almost ten years in one of the most famous vineyards of the world: Bordeaux! A place where I had very good wine, yes, but not only: everyday I would meet groups of people from all over the world and tell them about our French art-de-vivre, culture and History.
- 💻 Now, I’m currently learning how to become a successful Web Developer with a two-year online training.
- Among many other things, I learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, how to think mobile first, Figma, Adobe XD, Javascript, React.js, MySQL, PHP, Symfony... I'm starting various projects to try and master the secrets of The Force! 🧙‍♂️ And also maybe one day build the Apps of tomorrow!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project with a team that can help me improve my skills. 📈
