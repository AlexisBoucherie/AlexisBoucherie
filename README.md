👋 Bonjour!

I am @AlexisBoucherie, I am 34 yo and I'm French.

👀 I’m interested in discovering the world, meeting new people, reading, hiking and playing RPGs. And of course coding, but do I really have to say it? ;)

:wine_glass: I had the chance to be a tour guide for almost ten years in one of the most famous vineyards of the world: Bordeaux! A place where I had very good wine (best in world, of course!) but not only: everyday I would meet hundreds of people from all over the planet and tell them about our French art-de-vivre, culture and History.

💻 Now, I’m currently learning how to become a successful Web Developer with a training at Wild Code School, Bordeaux.

Among many other things, I learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, how to think mobile first, Figma, Javascript, React.js, MySQL, PHP, Symfony, Twig... I've now started various projects to try and master the secrets of The Force! 🧙‍♂️ And also maybe one day build the websites and softwares of tomorrow!

Here are a few Github repos I'd like to share:
- :open_file_folder: My portfolio > https://github.com/AlexisBoucherie/portfolio-v2
- :earth_americas: A PHP random map generator > https://github.com/AlexisBoucherie/random-map-generator
- :game_die: A small JS 2-player mobile game > https://github.com/AlexisBoucherie/js-dice-game
- :european_castle: A fun RPG-style resumee > https://github.com/AlexisBoucherie/online-cv


:rocket: I’m looking to collaborate on any project with a joyful fellowship.
